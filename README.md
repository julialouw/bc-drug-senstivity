Breast cancer represents a formidable challenge in the realm of oncology, accounting for a significant portion of cancer-related mortality worldwide. It is the most common cancer among women globally, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases diagnosed in 2020 alone (WHO). Breast cancer is characterized by diverse molecular subtypes and complex disease progression, and a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of the disease is essential to improve treatment outcomes. The use of precision medicine in breast cancer treatment, such as the “Trastuzumab” trial for using the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) to target the HER2 receptor in HER2+ breast cancer, offered promising avenues for personalized treatment (Slamon et al 2001). However, challenges still persist, particularly in addressing drug resistance and metastatic disease progression (Sorlie et al., 2001; Jiang et al., 2020). The limitations of precision medicine, highlighted by the high cost and limited success of clinical trials, have underscored the need for alternative therapeutic strategies, including drug repurposing and targeting micrometastatic disease (Nyugen et al., 2013).

In light of these challenges and opportunities, my study aims to investigate the gene expression profiles of HER2+ and Luminal B breast cancer subtypes to elucidate common mechanisms underlying resistance to standard chemotherapy agents and identify potential biomarkers predictive of treatment response. Given the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, with subtypes having varying treatment responses, understanding drug resistance across these subtypes is crucial. Specifically, I hypothesize that HER2+ and Luminal B cancers resistant to chemotherapy exhibit similar gene expression patterns, suggesting commonality in drug sensitivity factors across subtypes. By analyzing data from GEO repository GSE162187 and integrating insights from previous studies, I aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to overcome drug resistance and improve outcomes for breast cancer patients.
